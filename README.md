# AI-Driven Digital Twin of an Electric Scooter Powertrain (Scilab)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a simulation-based digital twin of an electric scooter powertrain
developed using Scilab. The model integrates battery behavior, motor dynamics, vehicle
longitudinal dynamics, and road load effects to analyze energy consumption and performance.

## 🚀 Features
- Lithium-ion battery modeling with State of Charge (SoC) estimation
- Motor torque-based vehicle dynamics
- Rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag modeling
- Integrated battery–motor power flow
- Realistic speed saturation behavior
- Energy consumption analysis during driving

## 🧠 Tools Used
- Scilab
- Xcos (optional extension)
- MATLAB-like scripting (.sce files)

## 📂 Repository Structure

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open Scilab
2. Set working directory to `codes`
3. Run:
   - `battery_model.sce`
   - `motor_vehicle_model.sce`

## 📊 Results
- Vehicle speed increases smoothly and saturates due to road load effects
- Battery State of Charge decreases realistically based on motor power demand

## 🎓 Applications
- EV powertrain analysis
- Digital twin development
- Battery energy management studies
- Academic and industry-oriented EV simulations
